<h2 style="text-align: center;">Description</h2>

<p>Minesweeper is a nerve-racking game where the player is presented with a field full of hidden mines. The goal is to find all of them and stay safe. It's not a game of wild guessing, so there are hints on the field: some cells show the number of mines around them. It's all about strategy!</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Objective</h2>

<p>Your first step is easy: you need to output some state of the field.</p>

<p>Choose any field size and place any number of mines on the field the way you want it. At this point, all the mines are in plain sight, so you don't have to hide them from the user yet.</p>

<p>You can represent mines and safe cells by any characters at this step. Further on, we will use <code class="java">X</code> for mines and <code class="java">.</code> for safe cells.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Example</h2>

<p>In this example, there are 10 mines on a 9x9 field.<em> </em>Feel free to use your own marking symbols and field configuration!</p>
